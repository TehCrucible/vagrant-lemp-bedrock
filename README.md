# bedrock-lemp

Installs a Vagrant box suitable for running Wordpress with Roots.io Bedrock.

Put `Vagrantfile` and `bootstrap.sh` inside a folder and do a `vagrant up` on the command line.
This box uses Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "Trustry Thar" 64bit, so if you don't have the basic box already, do a 
`vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64` before.
